        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img id="profilepic" src="assets/images/profilepicture.jpg" alt="Ben Knoll">
        <p>  I was born on May 23, 1988 in Kansas City, Missouri. As a young boy I greatly enjoyed following my dad around his garage and helping him to "build" things. This cultivated the passion for creating objects early on in my life. Which led me to my current trade of furniture making. In 2015 my wife and I relocated to Rockport, Maine were I attended the Center for Furniture Craftsmanship and studied traditional furniture construction.</p>
         <p>  Currently, I am attending the University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp in the hopes of transitioning into a new career field that offers an inventive and collabortive work environment which will utilize my desire to build and create.</p>
         <p>  My hobbies include cheering for the Kansas City Royals, traveling, taking my dogs, Snoopy and Clyde on walks, playing video games, and binge watching 90's television shows with my wife.</p>
